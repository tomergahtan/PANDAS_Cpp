# PANDAS_Cpp (*still in building*)
create pandas library in c++.<br>
### what we created meanwhile
* class NA - a class that containes an empty variable. 
* class element - a variable class that contains all possible types of a singe variable(including class NA).
* class series - a dynamic array of elements.
* class dataframe - a dynamic table that presents serieses as columns.


### final purpose
to perform all possible functionalities exists in the original python library but faster <br>
due to faster running time of c++ compare to python
